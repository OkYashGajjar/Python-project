# Python Gambling Simulator

This is a simple command-line gambling simulator written in Python. It allows users to deposit money, select lines to bet on, place bets, and spin for a chance to win.

## Features

*   **Deposit System:** Users can deposit a specified amount of money to start playing.
*   **Line Selection:** Users can choose how many lines they want to bet on.
*   **Bet Placement:** Users can place a bet per line.
*   **Spinning Mechanism:** The simulator "spins" a set of numbers (represented by a matrix or list of lists).
*   **Win Calculation:** The simulator checks for winning combinations based on the selected lines and calculates the winnings.
*   **Balance Update:** The user's balance is updated after each spin, reflecting wins or losses.

## How to Run

1.  **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
    ```
3.  **Navigate to the Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd <Python-project>
    ```
4.  **Run the Script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py  
    ```

## Game Logic

The game flow is as follows:

1.  The user is prompted to deposit money.
2.  The user is asked to select the number of lines they want to bet on.
3.  The user is asked to enter their bet amount per line.
4.  The simulator generates a "spin" result (a matrix of numbers).
5.  The simulator checks the selected lines for winning combinations. The specific winning conditions (e.g., matching numbers in a row, column, or diagonal) are defined in the code.
6.  The user's winnings (if any) are calculated based on the bet amount and the winning combinations.
7.  The user's balance is updated.
8.  The user is given the option to play again.

## Code Structure

*   `main.py` (or your main script): Contains the main game loop and user interaction logic.

## Example

(Provide a brief example of the game interaction, if possible. This helps users understand how to play.)
